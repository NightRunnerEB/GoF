# Documentation

The `docs` folder is the place for study notes, diagrams, and cross-language comparisons.

Suggested layout:

```
docs/
├── overview.md          # Common concepts and glossary
├── creational.md        # Notes about creational patterns
├── structural.md        # Notes about structural patterns
└── behavioral.md        # Notes about behavioral patterns
```

Add or reshape files as you expand the project, and link back to these documents from the pattern READMEs.
